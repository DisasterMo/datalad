# Summary

... should include Statement of Need

![DataLad: overview of available commands for various parts of the data management process](figures/datalad_process.png)


## Modular composition

## Execution provenance tracking



## Documentation

[DataLad Handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org) provide novices and advanced users of all backgrounds with a guide through both the basics of DataLad and start-to-end use cases of specific applications. [docs.datalad.org](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/) provides developers oriented information and detailed description of command line and Python interfaces.

# DataLad Ecosystem

... should mention any past or ongoing research projects using the software and recent scholarly publications enabled by it.

## Extensions

DataLad provides mechanism for providing domain or technology specific extensions.
Notable extensions at the moment are
- [datalad-container](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-container)
- [datalad-neuroimaging](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-neuroimaging)
The same mechanism is used for rapid development of new functionality to later be moved into the main DataLad codebase 
(e.g., [datalad-metalad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-metalad/))

## Integrations

[ReproMan](http://reproman.repronim.org) integrates with DataLad to provide
[OpenNeuro](http://openneuro.org) is using DataLad for data logistics with data deposited to a public S3 bucket.

## Datasets

DataLad datasets collections
- [http://datasets.datalad.org]() - a DataLad superdataset collating hundreds of datasets covering hundreds of TBs of largely neural data
- [https://github.com/datalad-datasets]() - interesting open data resources

# Citations
