Subject: Invitation to co-author a DataLad paper for JOSS

Dear {name},

Thank you for your previous contribution to DataLad (https://github.com/datalad/datalad), by code, issues, or feedback.

We are working on a manuscript to be submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software (https://joss.theoj.org) to describe DataLad, and would like to acknowledge your contribution(s).  We are inviting you to co-author the paper, or, alternatively, give us permission to thank you in the Acknowledgements section of the paper.

If you would like to co-author the paper, please review the authorship criteria of JOSS at https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#authorship and pay particular attention to potential implications of the "co-authors agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work" rule. If you personally consider a co-authorship appropriate under these conditions, please

- submit a Pull Request with changes to http://github.com/datalad/datalad-paper-joss/blob/master/paper.md in which you
  - uncomment (remove leading #) your record
  - add your details (name, ORCID, affiliation) and/or adjust your name (if needed).
- vote on your choice of title on https://github.com/datalad/datalad-paper-joss/issues/9

If you would like to just be acknowledged, please either reply to this email stating that, or submit a PR with your name appropriately listed in the Acknowledgements section of https://github.com/datalad/datalad-paper-joss/blob/master/paper.md and remove the pre-created record with your name from the header.

If you would like to neither be listed among co-authors, nor acknowledged, we would appreciate if you reply and let us know about that.

We are planing to submit the manuscript next week (on/after April 12), and will appreciate if you act on this invitation by the end of this week.
Co-author records which would remain commented out will be removed before submission.

Thank you again for your contribution to DataLad!

Sincerely,
DataLad Team
