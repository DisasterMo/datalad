Subject: Invitation to co-author a DataLad paper for JOSS

Dear {name},

Thank you for your previous contribution to DataLad (https://github.com/datalad/datalad), by code, issues, or feedback.

We are working on a manuscript to be submitted to JOSS (https://joss.theoj.org) to describe DataLad, and would like to acknowledge your contribution(s).  We are inviting you to co-author the paper, or, alternatively, give us permission to thank you in the Acknowledgements section of the paper.

If you would like to co-author the paper, please review the authorship criteria of JOSS at https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#authorship and pay particular attention to potential implications of the "co-authors agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work" rule. If you personally consider a co-authorship appropriate under these conditions, please submit a Pull Request with your details (name, ORCID, affiliation) added to the header of the https://github.com/datalad/datalad-paper-joss/blob/master/paper.md file after

# Add additional authors here

If you would like to just be acknowledged, please either reply to this email stating that, or submit a PR with your name appropriately listed in the Acknowledgements section of the https://github.com/datalad/datalad-paper-joss/blob/master/paper.md .

If you would like to neither be listed among co-authors, nor acknowledged, we would appreciate if you reply and let us know about that.
We are planing to submit manuscript next week (on/after April 12), and will appreciate if you act on this invitation by the end of this week.

Thank you for your contribution to DataLad

Sincerely,
DataLad Team
